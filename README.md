# Salesforce_TexttoLookupMigrator

This component would assist in converting text fields to lookup fields, a common requirement during data migration or restructuring. It could include the following features:

 

Field Selection: This feature would allow users to select the text field they want to convert into a lookup field.

 

Mapping Configuration: This feature would enable users to define how the text values map to the records of the lookup object. For example, if a text field contains a user’s full name and it’s being converted to a lookup field of a User object, the component could map the text values to User records based on their ‘Name’ field.

 

Mapping Filter: allows users to filter common characters in texts to imporve matching for example many company names are appended with Ltd ,pvt Ltd but their related record might only have company name without the appended characters.

 

Data Migration: Once the mapping is configured, this feature would migrate the data from the text field to the lookup field. It could also handle exceptions (e.g., if a text value doesn’t match any record of the lookup object) by either skipping those records or logging them for review.

 

Validation and Rollback: After the migration, this feature would validate that all data has been correctly transferred. If any issues are detected, it could roll back the changes.

 

Reporting: Post-migration, the component could provide a detailed report outlining how many records were successfully migrated, skipped, or logged for review.

 

This component would be particularly useful for large-scale data migrations, ensuring data integrity while saving time and reducing manual effort.
